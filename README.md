# CastQuest Forge - A Farcaster-Powered On-Chain RPG

CastQuest Forge is the frontend interface and smart contract suite for a persistent, on-chain social RPG designed to be played on Farcaster. Players can register their Farcaster identity, complete quests, battle monsters, craft powerful NFT-based gear, and compete on leaderboards, with all significant progress and ownership recorded on the blockchain.

This project represents a complete and well-architected Web3 application, featuring a modern React frontend, a sophisticated smart contract system for game logic and assets, and seamless wallet integration.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **On-Chain Player Progression:** Player data, including Experience Points (XP), levels, and quest completions, are managed by the `GameManager` smart contract, creating a persistent and verifiable player history.
*   **Farcaster Integration:** Players register using their Farcaster FID, linking their social identity to their on-chain character. The game is designed to be interacted with via a Farcaster bot (e.g., `@questmaster`).
*   **NFT-Based Equipment (ERC-721):** Unique game items like weapons, armor, and shields are represented as individual NFTs (`QuestGear.sol`). Each item has distinct stats and rarity, and players have true ownership.
*   **Crafting & Materials (ERC-1155):** Stackable items like crafting materials and consumables are managed by an efficient ERC-1155 contract (`QuestMaterials.sol`), allowing players to gather resources and craft new items based on on-chain recipes.
*   **Comprehensive UI:** A clean, responsive user interface for players to manage their game state:
    *   **Dashboard:** View character stats, level progression, and recent activity.
    *   **Inventory:** See all owned ERC-721 gear and ERC-1155 materials.
    *   **Crafting Station:** A UI to combine materials into new items.
    *   **Quest Log:** A history of all completed, failed, and in-progress quests.
    *   **Leaderboards:** View rankings for top players.
*   **Modern Web3 Wallet Integration:** Seamless wallet connection powered by **@reown/appkit** and **wagmi**, providing a smooth and user-friendly experience.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Smart Contract Architecture

The game's logic is powered by a modular and gas-efficient set of Solidity smart contracts, designed for the Base network.

| Contract              | Standard  | Purpose                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`GameManager.sol`**     | Custom    | The core engine. Manages player registration (FID-to-wallet), XP, levels, and quest completion with cooldowns.      |
| **`QuestGear.sol`**       | ERC-721   | Manages unique, equippable NFT items like weapons and armor, each with specific stats and rarity.                 |
| **`QuestMaterials.sol`**  | ERC-1155  | Manages stackable items like crafting resources and potions. Includes the logic for on-chain crafting recipes. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or later recommended) and an `npm`-compatible package manager installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/test-lexion-castquest-forge.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd test-lexion-castquest-forge
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project by copying the example:
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, edit the `.env` file and add your WalletConnect `projectId`.
    ```env
    # Get yours at: https://cloud.reown.com
    VITE_REOWN_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE"
    ```

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
